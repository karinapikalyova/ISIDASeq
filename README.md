[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/389562178.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/389562178)

## Description
Open-source tool for numerical encoding of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. The ISIDASeq framework integrates generation of k-mers of different length, grouped by various physico-chemical properties, with diverse normalization types, and inclusion of reverse complements (to avoid overcounting of k-mers that are mirror representations of each other).
